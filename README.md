This repository holds mostly notes I have compiled as I learn python. Wherever necessary, links to the source materials are included in the python file or Jupyter Notebook. 

A few notebooks are worth mentioning that have been carefully written up as standalone notebooks that take a moreorless detailed look at a particular data set. These notebooks are mostly meant to highlight how even the simplest of data setscan be analysed to an extent that one might not have expected. 

**Data Analysis with python**

* **Analysing the diamonds data set**


This data set provides a few attributes about diamonds. In this notebook, we take a look at this data set to look for key trends, relationships and any particularly interesting features about the data set. The analysis can be accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gonnel/a-pandas-diamonds-exploration) or simply taking a look at the raw IPython [notebook](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/sweetpy/blob/6b855d7fddfb257d2fc9b8333d3881a802c67dec/pandas_and_diamonds.ipynb).

* **Analysis of the Iris data set**

The iris data set is perhaps one of the most popular data sets available only being rivaled by MNIST and the Titanic data sets. One might refer to it as a Hello World data set. This notebook analyses the iris data set and shows sample implementations of regression analysis using python. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/sweetpy/blob/6b855d7fddfb257d2fc9b8333d3881a802c67dec/flowers_and_pandas.ipynb).
