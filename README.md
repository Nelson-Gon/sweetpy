# sweetpy
A collection of python notes and  sample projects. 

They are mostly written to test and implement what I learn as I traverse the python verse.


**Work in Progress**

1. **`nobel_prize.py`** 
    
    This is a very basic exploration of the various ways of getting, loading and manipulating `json` data.  
The project currently provides a from-basics exploration of Nobel Prize winners by name, number of awardees 
and the motivation for each award.

2. **`flowers_and_pandas`**

A Jupyter Notebook that takes a look at `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`. It's basically taking a seemingly simple data set(**The famous iris**) and using it to perform basic data analysis.
